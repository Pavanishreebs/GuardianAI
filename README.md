Phishing & Deepfake Threats

Increasingly sophisticated phishing emails and deepfakes deceive users and bypass traditional detection.

Deepfakes are used for identity spoofing, disinformation, and social engineering.

Insider Threats & Anomalies

Insider threats account for a significant percentage of security breaches.

Detecting anomalous behavior in real-time is challenging due to data complexity and evolving threat vectors.
